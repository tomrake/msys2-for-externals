* msys2-for-externals

The purpose of this system is to add the msys2 library path to the cffi:*foreign-library-directories*.

This allow many of the msys2 dlls to be found by common lisp cffi "glue" code on windows.

The location of the msys2 distribution and which msys2 enviroment to use are my personal choice.
